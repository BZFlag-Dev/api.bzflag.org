# BZFlag Web API

This will provide a private and public RESTful API to interact with various BZFlag data.
Initially it will allow the manipulation of organizations, groups, and hosting keys.

## TODO

Beyond the full set of API resources, the following need to be completed:

* Authentication/Authorization
* Private API vs Public API
* Logging
* Tests
* Documentation
* Applying RESTful best practices
